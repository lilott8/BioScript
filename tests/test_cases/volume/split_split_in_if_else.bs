module fluorescence
manifest PCRMix

instructions:
z = dispense 20 units of PCRMix
b = split z into 2
d = dispense 5 units of PCRMix

heat d at 94c for 2m

DNA_Sensor = detect fluorescence on d for 30s

if (DNA_Sensor <= 80) {
    a = split b[0] into 2
}
else {
    c = split b[1] into 2
}

dispose d
